<h1 class="welcome"> Welcome to our Recipe App </h1>

<p class="app-description">The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will 
allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate 
a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. 
Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you 
to make them public so anyone can access them. </p>
